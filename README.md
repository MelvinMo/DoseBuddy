**DoseBuddy** is an innovative solution designed to combat medication non-adherence, especially for older adults. This project combines advanced automation, user-friendly design, and smart connectivity to ensure accurate and timely medication delivery.

## Overview

DoseBuddy is a modular automatic pill dispenser that addresses key challenges in medication management. Developed as part of the *Mobility in Aging II* course, this project focuses on usability, security, and reliability to support users and caregivers.

### Key Features
- **Modular Design**: Stackable layers (1-4) with customizable compartments for varying medication needs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: LCD display, audio-visual alerts, and a web-based app for scheduling and monitoring.
- **Remote Control & Security**: WiFi-enabled app for remote locking/unlocking and caregiver notifications.
- **Reliable Operation**: Battery backup for power outages and weight sensors to track medication intake.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Alerts for missed doses and integration with caregiver support systems.

## Project Goals
- Combat medication non-adherence with precise dispensing.
- Enhance accessibility for older adults through intuitive design.
- Provide security and reliability with remote access and backup systems.
- Support caregivers with real-time updates and simplified management.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Our MVP demonstrates the core functionality of DoseBuddy's base layer:
- **Time-Based Dispensing**: Program up to 6 daily time slots for accurate pill release.
- **User Feedback**: Button confirmation and status indicators (LCD & LED).
- **WiFi Connectivity**: Remote schedule management via a web interface.
- **Error Handling**: Robust operation even during network or power interruptions.

## Hardware & Software
- **Hardware**: Arduino Uno R4 WiFi, stepper motor, LCD display, and 3D-printed components (PLA & TPU).
- **Software**: Web-based UI for scheduling and monitoring, compatible with mobile and PC devices.
- **Total Cost**: ~$85 (see Bill of Materials in the full report).

## Installation & Setup
1. **Hardware Assembly**: Follow the MVP design in the repository to assemble the base layer and electronics.
2. **Software Setup**: Upload the provided Arduino code to the board and connect to WiFi for app integration.
3. **Web Interface**: Access the DoseBuddy app via any WiFi-enabled device to manage schedules.

## Usage
